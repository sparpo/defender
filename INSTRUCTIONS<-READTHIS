DIA DUIT MO CHAIRDE! If you are reading this you should have already cloned the git repository to your computer. This file will tell you how to run this app.
INSTRUCTIONS:
-make sure repository was cloned to "C:/Users/Windows 7". If you already cloned the file to somewhere else, find the file "defender" and move it "C:/Users/Windows 7".
-look up, download & install "node.js"
-open command prompt and type "npm install -g cordova". (make sure the directory is "C:/Users/Windows 7>")
-in command prompt type "cd defender/app"
-to test app type "cordova run browser" (if this doesnt work tell me)
