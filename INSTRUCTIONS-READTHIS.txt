DIA DUIT MO CHAIRDE. This file will tell you how to run this app.
INSTRUCTIONS:

~SETTING UP GIT~
-download and install any git client. (I recommend "GitKraken", "Source Tree". (microsoft visual code is also a git client but with less features))
-If you are reading this then you are on github, now, go back to previous page and click "clone or download"( its a green button).
-Copy the url given by the green button.
-Go to your git client, there should be a new repository button, once clicked there should be a "clone" option
-You should be prompted to give a url and a path to download the file to. 
-I highly recommend setting the path to "C:\Users\Windows 7\documents" (this avoids confusion, if you cant do this, tell me)

~RUNNING THE APP~
-make sure repository was cloned to "C:\Users\Windows 7\documents". If you already cloned the file to somewhere else, i recommend you find the file "defender" and move it "C:\Users\Windows 7\documents".
-look up, download & install "node.js"
-open command prompt and type "npm install -g cordova". (make sure the directory is "C:\Users\Windows 7>" NOT "C:\Users\Windows 7\documents")
-in command prompt type "cd documents\defender\app"
-to test app type "cordova run browser" (if this doesnt work tell me)
